This is an application to provide the nifty (but, sadly, expensive) Qlock
(at http://www.qlocktwo.com/) as software for the Mac. Currently, it's not worth
much but amusement, but I will extend it to replace the desktop and to work as a
screensaver.

The current application uses Helvetica and expands, tastefully, into the given
space. It currently requires 10.5 for the excellent CoreText api that provides
easy typographic information.
